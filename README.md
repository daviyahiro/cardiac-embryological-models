# Creation of cardiac embryological models for 3D printing to teach anatomy and embryology

Here, I present the development of cardiac embryological models designed for 3D printing to enhance the teaching of anatomy and embryology. The objective is to facilitate learning by providing .stl files for visualizing and printing heart models.

I believe that you will find this resource valuable for both teaching and learning about cardiac development. Thank you for your attention and interest in our cardiac embryological models. If you have any questions or require further information, please feel free to reach out.
