# Creation of cardiac embryological models for 3D printing to teach anatomy and embryology

Here it's presented the creation of cardiac embryological models for 3D printing to teach anatomy and embryology. The intention is to facilitate learning by presenting the .stl files for visualization or printing the heart models.

I hope you find this helpful for teaching and learning the cardiac formation.
